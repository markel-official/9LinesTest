# 9Lines

I've deployed site here -> https://markeloff.site/prototypes/9lines/

I've also had few questions about your ninelines-template. Since it was pretty new working environment for me.

If you have any questions then you are free to ask! I understand that maybe I've implemented something not the way you were expecting - and I am ready to discuss in the interview and explain my solutions.



## P.S.
I've checked files with linters for a "vital" errors and haven't found one.
However I think there are some problem with my code editor(using VSCode) since linter is keep marking intendations as error.
Also of course I'm using "tab".

So please don't pay attention to this errors since in the future I will figure out what's the problem and fix it.
